## Welcome to ArtisanSawdust

We are a small company that specialises in integration of IoT Devices and improvemnets of home wifi speeds.

Often the broadband speeds that we pay for are rarley achieved, it does not have to be this way. Often the Wifi speed is limited by the the hardware in use and the speed is being deliverd to your home router. Simple hardware upgrades from Â£300 (August 2024), can greatly improve your wifi connectivity (speed and range).

If you would like help with your wifi connectivity in the East Lothian Region please contact us on:
